# TheSnakeGame

TheSnakeGame is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades becoming something of a classic. It's an honor for me to create a game like this. 
It was the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones while i was growing up.

Easy Instructions of the Game => 

"The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid
hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows."
